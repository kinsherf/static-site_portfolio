                  <p class="greeting"> As a kid, I always had a love for art. I spent most of my childhood days making comics and graffiti art on paper. As I got older, I fell out of it and worked in human services helping adults with mental illness and developmental disabilities. Although it was some of the most rewarding work I've ever done, I wanted to get back into the design field which led me to beginning a career in graphic design. I worked as a graphic designer in a marketing department for two years before switching my focus to user experience design. I've found UX to be rewarding because it combinse my love for people, with my love for art and technology!</p>
